# Myles Mobi Site 

## My personal blog

I build this website as my personal blog site. Contents about literature and my work will be presented on and on.

## The building of the site

Blogs in this site will be writen in markdown language and be converted to html5 with mylesmarkdown.pl (a perl script customized from John Gruber's Markdownv1.0.1)

## How to parse

`perl mylesmarkdown.pl --html4tags _target.md_ > _target.html_`

## Dependencies

* Bootstrap 2 embedded in html header 
* Perl 5.6 +
